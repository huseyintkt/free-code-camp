                <p>Use Bootstrap’s custom button styles for actions in forms, dialogs, and more with support for
                    multiple sizes, states, and more.</p>
                <p>Using color to add meaning only provides a visual indication, which will not be conveyed to users of
                    assistive technologies – such as screen readers. Ensure that information denoted by the color is
                    either obvious from the content itself (e.g. the visible text), or is included through alternative
                    means, such as additional text hidden with the class.</p>
                <p>When using button classes on elements that are used to trigger in-page functionality (like collapsing
                    content), rather than linking to new pages or sections within the current page, these links should
                    be given a role="button" to appropriately convey their purpose to assistive technologies such as
                    screen readers.</p>

                <p>Alerts are available for any length of text, as well as an optional dismiss button. For proper
                    styling, use one of the eight required contextual classes (e.g., .alert-success). For inline
                    dismissal, use the alerts jQuery plugin.</p>

            <article>
                <p>Note that depending on how they are used, badges may be confusing for users of screen readers and
                    similar assistive technologies. While the styling of badges provides a visual cue as to their
                    purpose, these users will simply be presented with the content of the badge. Depending on the
                    specific situation, these badges may seem like random additional words or numbers at the end of a
                    sentence, link, or button.

                    Unless the context is clear (as with the “Notifications” example, where it is understood that the
                    “4” is the number of notifications), consider including additional context with a visually hidden
                    piece of additional text.</p>

            <header>Card</header>
            <article>
                <p>About
                    A card is a flexible and extensible content container. It includes options for headers and footers,
                    a wide variety of content, contextual background colors, and powerful display options. If you’re
                    familiar with Bootstrap 3, cards replace our old panels, wells, and thumbnails. Similar
                    functionality to those components is available as modifier classes for cards.

                </p>
                <p>Example
                    Cards are built with as little markup and styles as possible, but still manage to deliver a ton of
                    control and customization. Built with flexbox, they offer easy alignment and mix well with other
                    Bootstrap components. They have no margin by default, so use spacing utilities as needed.

                    Below is an example of a basic card with mixed content and a fixed width. Cards have no fixed width
                    to start, so they’ll naturally fill the full width of its parent element. This is easily customized
                    with our various sizing options.</p>
                <div class="card" style="width: 18rem;">
                    <img src="..." class="card-img-top" alt="...">
                    <div class="card-body">
                        <h5 class="card-title">Card title</h5>
                        <p class="card-text">Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of
                            the card's content.</p>
                        <a href="#" class="btn btn-primary">Go somewhere</a>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="pagination">
            <header>Pagination</header>
            <p>We use a large block of connected links for our pagination, making links hard to miss and easily
                scalable—all while providing large hit areas. Pagination is built with list HTML elements so screen
                readers can announce the number of available links. Use a wrapping <nav> element to identify it as a
                    navigation section to screen readers and other assistive technologies.

                    In addition, as pages likely have more than one such navigation section, it’s advisable to provide a
                    descriptive aria-label for the <nav> to reflect its purpose. For example, if the pagination
                        component is used to navigate between a set of search results, an appropriate label could be
                        aria-label="Search results pages".</p>
            <nav aria-label="Page navigation example">
                <ul class="pagination">
                    <li class="page-item"><a class="page-link" href="#">Previous</a></li>
                    <li class="page-item"><a class="page-link" href="#">1</a></li>
                    <li class="page-item"><a class="page-link" href="#">2</a></li>
                    <li class="page-item"><a class="page-link" href="#">3</a></li>
                    <li class="page-item"><a class="page-link" href="#">Next</a></li>
                </ul>
            </nav>
